              <p>The Global Justice Project is a legal aid crowdfunding platform for worthy, high impact case work.&nbsp;<a data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top"><span class="small-link">(^ top)</span></a>

              <h4 id="what-does-legal-aid-encompass" class="faq-header">What does legal aid encompass?</h4>
              <p>Legal aid means providing legal services to people who can’t afford it. &nbsp;
                <br>
                <br>We think the concept should be thought of in a broad sense. &nbsp;This means that it covers not just advocacy before the courts but could also mean providing legal advice, investigations, representation for detainees. <a data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top"><span class="small-link">(^ top)</span></a>
              </p>
              <h4 id="why-is-legal-aid-important" class="faq-header">Why is legal aid important?</h4>
              <p>In a just legal system, access to justice should not depend on a person's economic status. &nbsp;Legal aid helps those who are poorest access legal services they would otherwise be unable to afford.
                <br>
                <br>Equal representation before the law is a fundamental human right incorporated into many international conventions and national constitutions, including the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. &nbsp;So one way to think about legal aid is as an underpinning human right, because it helps to ensure that other rights are upheld. <a data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top"><span>(^ top)</span></a>

              <p>We are a small, dedicated team which allows us to get a lot done with minimal overheads. &nbsp;We fund our day to day operations through various grants and donations. &nbsp;You can help us keep The Global Justice Project running by tipping us when you make a donation to a specific case, or through a separate individual donation. &nbsp;We don’t take any cut of donations allocated to specific cases for operational costs.&nbsp;<a data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top"><span>(^ top)</span></a>

              <h4 id="who-is-eligible-for-the-global-justice-project-funding" class="faq-header">Who is eligible for the Global Justice Project funding?</h4>
              <p>Those eligible for the Global Justice Project will be individuals or groups whom:
                <br>
                <br>(1)&nbsp;have suffered from human rights abuses; and
                <br>(2)&nbsp;are unable to afford essential legal services they require.
                <br>
                <br>Human rights abuses refers to a range of criminal and civil offenses, including violations of rights contained in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and various national constitutions. &nbsp;To give you an idea, this could mean human and child trafficking, rape, torture, physical abuse, arbitrary detention and illegal land grabs. <a class="small-link" href="#top">(^ top)</a>

              <h4 id="can-the-global-justice-project-victims-pay-for-their-cases" class="faq-header">Can the Global Justice Project victims pay for their cases?</h4>
              <p>No. The cases we work with are brought by individuals or groups who would otherwise be unable to pay for legal representation. &nbsp;<a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>

              <h4 id="who-decides-which-victims-receive-the-global-justice-project-fundings" class="faq-header">Who decides which cases get put forward onto the Global Justice Project platform?</h4>
              <p>Local lawyers and organizations on the ground are in the best position to make tough decisions on the merit of different cases to put forward. Our partner vetting process is extremely rigorous, so we have full confidence in the organizations that we accept as partners to make good decisions. &nbsp;We get our partners to provide a lot of input and trust them to direct our resources to where there is the greatest need. <a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>
              </p>
              <h4 id="what-does-the-cost-of-the-case-include" class="faq-header">What does the cost of the case include?</h4>
              <p>The cost of the case could include the cost of investigations, preparation of witnesses, basic needs for victims in detention (like food and clothing), lawyer's costs, court fees, and other expenses that are disclosed on the case pages. <a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>
              </p>
              <h4 id="what-if-a-profile-isnt-funded" class="faq-header">What if a profile isn't funded?</h4>
              <p>With crowdfunding there will always be a risk that a case won’t be fully funded. &nbsp;We take steps to minimize that risk by matching our case capacity to actual and forecasted donations to the platform, promoting cases within our network, and generally doing our best to ensure that any cases listed do get fully funded. &nbsp;
                <br>
                <br>If a case doesn’t get fully funded, but a specific element of a case has been (for example, the investigation), we ask our partner legal aid providers whether they want to receive that portion of the funds. &nbsp;If not, and in any case where the case will not proceed, then no payments will be made and you will not be charged. <a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>
              </p>
              <h4 id="how-do-i-know-the-case-will-be-a-success" class="faq-header">How do I know the case will be a success?</h4>
              <p>The short answer is that you don’t.
                <br>
                <br>We work hard with our partner organizations to ensure that cases with a high chance of success are prioritized. &nbsp;This means that the cases on our platform are worthy, high merit cases, and we have full confidence that the organization and lawyers behind the cases will do a good job representing their clients. &nbsp;
                <br>
                <br>While we try to maximize the success rate of our cases, we think it is important to bear in mind that access to justice should not necessarily depend on the potential success rate of a case, particularly where the chance of success is more often that not very much out of the control of a client. &nbsp;
                <br>
                <br>Finally, there is the problem of measuring success. &nbsp;The concept of a “successful” outcome is not always clear. &nbsp;For example, you may win your case but the perpetrator receives a short sentence, or you may have a very weak case yet only receive a small fine. &nbsp;In either case, win or lose, it is difficult to classify the outcome simply as a success or failure. In any case, we believe that failing to defending basic human rights is an automatic failure with negative implications at a personal, community, and country level. <a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>
              </p>
              <h4 id="Does-the-Global-Justice-Project-take-into-account-corruption-in-the-countries-in-which-it-operates" class="faq-header">Does the Global Justice Project take into account corruption in the countries in which it operates?</h4>
              <p>Corruption is one of the biggest impediments when it comes to access to justice. On the one hand, this might suggest that funding might not be the answer. &nbsp;On the other, places with the worst corruption often also have the greatest funding needs. One way we keep an eye on the impact of corruption on our cases is by tracking judgements analyzing why and how they succeeded or failed. &nbsp;
                <br>
                <br>Ultimately, we believe that bringing forward worthy cases and fighting to protect legal rights plays an important role in the general reform process. <a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>

              <h4 id="how-does-the-global-justice-project-handle-the-victims-privacy" class="faq-header">How does the Global Justice Project handle the victim's privacy?</h4>
              <p>Client confidentiality is something we take very seriously and we work with our partners to identify any potential issues from the outset. &nbsp;A client must always give permission before their profile can be publicized.
                <br>
                <br>We sometimes take further measures to protect a client’s privacy where necessary. &nbsp;This might include using false names or modified images. <a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>
              </p>
              <h4 id="why-are-the-cases-so-cheap" class="faq-header">Why are the cases so cheap?</h4>
              <p>Like other goods or services, the cost of legal services varies from country to country. We purposefully operate in countries where we can maximize the impact on global justice per dollar spent.&nbsp;<a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>

              <p>Our goal is to maximize the impact on global justice per dollar spent. &nbsp;Although there are funding shortages, the legal aid systems in Europe and the United States are among the most comprehensive in the world.
                <br>
                <br>This is not to say we won’t consider expanding to Europe of the United States in the future if we assess that there is an opportunity to make a difference there, but for now we will begin by operating where we perceive the greatest need to be.&nbsp;<a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>

              <h4 id="what-if-a-victim-needs-funds-before-their-profile-is-funded" class="faq-header">What if a victim needs&nbsp;funds before their profile is funded?</h4>
              <p>There are two ways that we approach this.
                <br>
                <br>(1)&nbsp;If a specific element of a case is fully funded, we give the relevant partner legal aid provider the option of having those funds released. &nbsp;There is no point holding back funds for an investigation that needs to take place urgently, because funds for a trial that is to take place months later have not been filled yet.
                <br>(2)&nbsp;In some of the most urgent cases, we use our global fund to release initial funds to cover relevant costs. &nbsp;These funds are then recouped when the case gets funded. <a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>
              </p>
              <h4 id="what-is-a-legal-aid-partner" class="faq-header">What is a legal aid partner?</h4>
              <p>A legal aid partner is a local legal aid organization that we work with to identify, evaluate, and select cases to fund. <a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>

              <p>Essentially two ways:
                <br>
                <br>(1)&nbsp;We identify legal aid partners through different channels or recommendations and approach them directly
                <br>(2)&nbsp;Legal aid organizations reach out to us
                <br>
                <br>Either way, each organization is subjected to a rigorous partner vetting process, where we look closely into the values of the organization and the work that they do. <a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>

              <p>The short answer is that you don’t.
                <br>
                <br>We work hard with our partner organizations to ensure that cases with a high chance of success are prioritized. &nbsp;This means that the cases on our platform are worthy, high merit cases, and we have full confidence that the organization and lawyers behind the cases will do a good job representing their clients. &nbsp;
                <br>
                <br>While we try to maximize the success rate of our cases, we think it is important to bear in mind that access to justice should not necessarily depend on the potential success rate of a case, particularly where the chance of success is more often that not very much out of the control of a client. &nbsp;
                <br>
                <br>Finally, there is the problem of measuring success. &nbsp;The concept of a “successful” outcome is not always clear. &nbsp;For example, you may win your case but the perpetrator receives a short sentence, or you may have a very weak case yet only receive a small fine. &nbsp;In either case, win or lose, it is difficult to classify the outcome simply as a success or failure. In any case, we believe that failing to defending basic human rights is an automatic failure with negative implications at a personal, community, and country level. <a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>

              <p>Yes, absolutely. We cover all overhead and payment processing with voluntary tips and corporate sponsorships, enabling 100% of donations to flow to the cases. You can even find our financials online here [xxx]. <a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>

              <p>Firstly, we validate the expenses associated with a case by asking our partner to provide a receipt of costs incurred. Secondly, if the case no longer requires the funds donated, we return the funds to donors. Lastly, after the case is fully funded and in progress, we provide updates on the case as developments unfold. This would not be possible without your contribution! <a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>

              <h4 id="how-do-the-donation-logistics-work" class="faq-header">How do the donation logistics work?</h4>
              <p>We work with 3rd party payment processors to handle foreign transactions and credit card processing. The service we currently use is Paypal.
                <br>
                <br>To ensure that 100% of the donations given reach the case, we cover the 0.20p per transaction and 1.4% of overall transaction amount fee for each contribution with other means of funding such as tips at checkout.
                <br>
                <br>Once a case is fully funded, we transfer the funds to the partner organization, who mobilize the funds for the purposes stated on the case page. <a class="small-link" data-rt-link-type="section" data-rt-link-domid="ce585e10-b8c1-498e-782f-20085e0f5d07" href="#top">(^ top)</a>

              <h4 id="can-i-donate-monthly" class="faq-header">Can I donate monthly?</h4>
              <p>Yes, we encourage recurring donations - you can find out more [here]. <a class="small-link" href="#top">(^ top)</a>

              <h4 id="am-i-really-funding-the-case-for-the-victim" class="faq-header">Am I really funding the case for the victim?</h4>
              <p>Funds donated to casework is used only towards the specific case selected and not for any other overheads. Donors can optionally give to our organization as a “tip” at checkout. <a class="small-link" href="#top">(^ top)</a>

              <h4 id="would-the-victims-still-be-served-if-their-case-wasnt-funded-on-the-global-justice-project" class="faq-header">What would happen to the victims and perpetrators if the case wasn't funded on the Global Justice Project?</h4>
              <p>We only take on cases that would have otherwise not been funded - many times, this means that the victim would continue to suffer from their pre-existing condition (e.g., remain in slavery), and the perpetrator would walk free, potentially entrapping other individuals in the process. <a class="small-link" href="#top">(^ top)</a>
              </p>
              <h4 id="why-was-my-credit-card-declined" class="faq-header">Why was my credit card declined?</h4>
              <p>There could be a variety of reasons your credit card was declined. If you have tried multiple times without success, try one of the following resolutions:
                <br>
                <br>(1)&nbsp;Use a different credit card
                <br>(2)&nbsp;Call your credit card provider to ensure your card is functional
                <br>(3) Check our site to see if there are any reported service outages
                <br>
